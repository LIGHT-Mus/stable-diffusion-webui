In this repo lives a mighty handy little wrapper for adding [openOutpaint](https://github.com/zero01101/openOutpaint) to [AUTOMATIC1111 webUI](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui) directly as a native extension.

Please see the respective READMEs and wikis for each of the above projects for a more comprehensive understanding of their feature sets.

This extension also adds buttons to send output from webUI txt2img and img2img tools directly to openOutpaint which will also include the prompts used for convenience.

**_2023-01-23: new `--lock-oo-submodule` commandline argument if you want to roll back to a previous version of openOutpaint and keep it there - be sure to install/run openOutpaint extension at least once before enabling this flag_**

**Note: Requires `--api` flag enabled in your webui-user launch script!**

**_FURTHER NOTE: the commandline flag `--gradio-debug` disables custom API routes and completely breaks openOutpaint. please remove it from your COMMANDLINE_ARGS before running openOutpaint._**

**_EVEN FURTHER NOTE: [PLEASE SEE DOCUMENTATION REGARDING NEW HRfix FEATURES](https://github.com/zero01101/openOutpaint/wiki/Manual#hrfix) IMPLEMENTED AS OF webUI COMMIT [ef27a18](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui/commit/ef27a18b6b7cb1a8eebdc9b2e88d25baf2c2414d)_**

### surprising incompatibilities

**_COLAB USERS: you may experience issues installing openOutpaint (and other webUI extensions) - there is a workaround that has been discovered and tested against [TheLastBen's fast-stable-diffusion](https://github.com/TheLastBen/fast-stable-diffusion). Please see [this discussion](https://github.com/TheLastBen/fast-stable-diffusion/discussions/1161) containing the workaround, which requires adding a command into the final cell of the colab, as well as setting `Enable_API` to `True`._**
